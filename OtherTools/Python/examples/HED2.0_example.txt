Event 
* Category [this is meant to designate the reason this event was recorded]
   * Initial context [the purpose is to set the starting context for the experiment --- and if there is no initial context event---this information would be stored as a dataset tag]
   * Participant response [the purpose of this event was to record the state or response of a participant. Note: participant actions may occur in other kinds of events, such as the experimenter  records a terrain change as an event and the participant happens to be walking. In this case the event category would be ‘Environmental’. In contrast, if the participant started walking in response to an instruction or to some other stimulus, the event would be recorded as ‘Participant response’]
   * Technical error [experimenters forgot to turn on something, the cord snagged, etc. and something may be wrong with the data]

Please note that the information under this tag is primarily not for use in the analysis and is provided for the convenience in referring to events in the context of a single study. Please use Custom tag to define custom event hierarchies] 
* Long name {recommended, transient} [A long name for the event which could be over 100 characters and could contain characters like vertical bars as separators. Long names are used for cases when one wants to encode a lot of information in a single string such as  ‘Scenario | VehiclePassing | TravelLaneBLocked | Onset’].

These tags will still be matched to each other, for example /Custom/Dance/Waltz is considered a subtype of /Custom/Dance.                                                                                                                Example: /Initial Score/# [monetary values in some currency, for example $1, or the ratio of the reward to the maximum possible (3 of max 10 becomes 0.3), or x Points]


Experiment Context [describes the context of the whole experiment or large portions of it, also includes tags that are common across all events, in the whole or large portions]
* [add common tags across all stimuli/ and/or responses here, e.g if all experimental events share /State/Drowsy, you can place it here instead of tagging each event individually ]
