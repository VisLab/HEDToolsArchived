CTagger-Java
==========

CTagger is a program that supports hierarchical tagging of elements based on a vocabulary
specified in a forest of tagging concepts. The CTagger effort arose out of the need for
tools to tag events associated with EEG and other experimental data. A common vocabulary
for this domain:  HED (hierarchical event descriptors) was developed to support this effort.

CTagger supports tagging with the latest HED event hierarchy, which is maintained on
GITHUB by the BigEEG Consortium: https://github.com/BigEEGConsortium/HED/wiki/HED-Schema.

To use the tool:

1)  Make sure you have Java JRE 1.6 or later installed.

2)  Download and run CTagger.jar.

This repository also includes all of the source (ctagger directory), a user guide, and sample data (data directory).

Tools to support HED 2.1 for MATLAB with EEGLAB integration are currently being converted from HED 1.0.
