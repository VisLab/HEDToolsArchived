Custom


This node can be used to organize events in an alternative (parallel) hierarchy: you can define your custom tags and hierarchies without any restriction under this node. These tags will still be matched to each other, for example /Custom/Dance/Waltz is considered a subtype of /Custom/Dance. 


Example: /Initial Score/# [monetary values in some currency, for example $1, or the ratio of the reward to the maximum possible (3 of max 10 becomes 0.3), or x Points]

Label
* [a short label for the event. For example /Label/Accept Button. Please note that the information under this tag will not be used in the analysis and is provided solely for the convenience in referring to events in the context of a single study.]


Description
* [A detailed description of the event as text, can be used to complement information encoded in other HED tags. Please note that information under this tag would be unusable by computers and analysis software and should not be used as the main method for describing events (use HED tags other than Description and Label to explain events in a machine-understandable manner)]


Group ID
* [ a string that uniquely identifies a group of related of events, e.g. events that describe visual and auditory stimulus onsets and offsets of a particular bird may all be tagged with /Group ID/Bird #54]


HED [Hierarchical Event Descriptor]
* # [HED specification version number: normally there is no need to specify the version number in the HED string since it will be matched by default to the most recent compliant version, but this tag can be used to specify the exact HED version the HED string was based on.]
