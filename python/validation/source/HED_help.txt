-------------------------HED txt to xml-------------------------
This utility is meant to convert an HED hierarchy in plain text
form into an XML tree. 'HED input' is a .txt file. This should
be obtained by converting the HED hierarchy from google docs to
plain text. No modifications to the plain text converted over
from google docs is necessary. 'Output file'is a pathname, with
the filename at the end that you would like the resulting
xml file to have. If you are on Windows and you do not wish to
use an xml viewer to look at the output, simply change the '.xml
file extension to '.txt'.

------------------------Validate HED xml------------------------
This utility is used to validate the xml form of the HED
hierarchy against an appropriate xml schema. 'XML schema'
is of course the file which contains the xml schema you would 
like to verify against. 'XML' is the file which contains the
HED hierarchy in xml form. 'XML error file' is the file which
will contain the result of the validation of the hierarchy
against the given schema. If there are no errors, the file
will contain the usual header, but with no errors reported.

---------------------------Verify tags--------------------------
This utility is used to check tags against a given HED
hierarchy. 'HED input' is the plain text file containing 
the HED hierarchy, as converted from the HED google doc
to plain text. 'Tags file' is a tab-separated-value file,
which contains the tags to be verified. 'Output' this will 
be the path for the output files with the name of the 
beginning of the output file names at the end. Note: there
will always be two output files, one called a warning 
report, another a error report. Items in the warning 
report may be correct, but require further inspection. 
Items in the error report are certainly incorrect. 
'Column list' is a list of integers which correspond to
the columns in the 'Tags file' which contain the tags to
be tested. The first column of the 'Tags file' is column
number one. So, column numbers cannnot be less than one,
and no greater than the maximum number of columns in each
line. Note: any single character can be used as a delimiter
for the column list, and separating white space will be 
ignored.

---------------------------HED mapping--------------------------
This utility prints out the full mapping, with comments, from 
one HED hierarchy to another. 'HED source txt' is the HED
hierarchy taken from a google doc, by converting from the google
doc to plain text. 'Remap HED' is the file which contains the
mapping itself. 'Map output' is the output file which contains
the full mapping from the given HED to the other given by 
'Remap HED'. The purpose of this utility is to check what has
and has not been mapped, and to examine everything that has 
been mapped between the two hierarchies.
