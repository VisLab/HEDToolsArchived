    <h2 id="using_validator">Using the validator</h2>
    <p>The HED Validator is an online-tool designed to make validation of HED tags easy. To start, put your HED tags
        in
        either an Excel file or a tab-separated text file. (Example files can be found in the <a href="#notes_examples">Notes
            and Examples</a>
        section.) Once you have a file, you are ready to begin the validation.</p>
    <h3 id="specify_file">Step 1: Specify the file to be validated.</h3>
    <p>Indicate the name of the file to validate, using the Browse button to navigate in your file system:</p>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/specify_file.png') }}">
    <h3 id="specify_columns">Step 2: Specify which columns of your file contain HED tags.</h3>
    <p>After you have selected a file, HED Validator will try to automatically fill in the remaining information
        into
        its form based on the contents of your file. In the following example, the file EmotionEventInformation.xlsx
        was
        selected. If a spreadsheet has multiple worksheets, HED Validator selects the first one by default
        (ImaginedEmotion), but provides a drop down for you to select a different one:</p>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/specify_columns.png') }}">
    <p>By default, the HED Validator assumes that the first row of the spreadsheet contains the names of the columns
        and
        uses these names to guess which columns correspond to special tags such as Event/Category or Event/Label. In
        the
        above example, the HED Validator guessed that the second column (entitled Category) holds the Event/Category
        tag. The Validator was also able to correctly guess the Event/Label and Event/Description columns. The
        Validator
        was not able to correctly able to identify LongName with Event/Long name, so we need to put 4 in the empty
        field
        next to it so that it gets the proper values for Long Name. In addition, the Validator also missed that
        column 8
        (called Other) also contained HED tags. After correcting we have:</p>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/correct_columns.png') }}">
    <h3 id="select_other_options">Step 3: Select the other options.</h3>
    <p>You can validate your file against any valid HED schema. The Validator automatically retrieves the latest HED
        version and also has copies of each of the previous major HED versions available through the HED version
        pull-down in the options section. You can also upload one of your own HED versions by selecting the Other
        option
        in the pull-down:</p>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/select_other_options.png') }}">
    <p>HED uses semantic versioning (X.Y.Z) where X denotes a major, backwards-incompatible change, Y denotes a
        major
        addition of functionality that is backwards-compatible, and Z denotes a minor backwards-compatible
        update.</p>
    <p>If your spreadsheet does not have column names, you should uncheck the Spreadsheet has column names box. All
        errors in your HED tag spreadsheet must be corrected, or downstream tools relying on HED might not work
        properly. However, when you first validate, you might want to ignore warnings until you have corrected all
        errors. Once you have the errors out, you should probably run again and take a look at the warnings.
        Warnings
        often help you detect faulty tagging that might not be syntactically incorrect.</p>
    <h3 id="click_submit">Step 4: Click the submit button to process the file.</h3>
    <p>On submission, the HED Validator processes the file and outputs a message indicating the number of errors and
        warnings that it found:</p>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/validation_issues.png') }}">
    <p>The HED Validator also writes error and warning messages to a text file for download and examination. Each
        message contains the type of error or warning as well as the row and column number in the input file where
        the
        issue occurred. If the HED validator detected no issues, you will see the following message. You should now
        be
        ready to use them to tag your study.</p>

    <p>Above is an example of a functional and validated spreadsheet. Each tag follows a tiered format.</p>
    <p>Notes Column by Column:</p>
    <p>A-Event code: These are set by the experimenter and they can
        be
        any number, letter, or combination of the two.
        (Examples: 1, A, Jump, leftclick01)</p>
    <p>B-Category: Specifies what type of event this signifies.
        (Examples: Participant response, Experimental
        stimulus/Instruction/Rest, Miscellaneous)</p>
    <p>C-Label: This says what it is. (Examples: Button press,
        Calibration pulse, or any other meaningful short
        identifier for this event.)</p>
    <p>D-LongName: The LongName allows you to give a more detailed
        label
        for an event. (Example: Introduction to
        experimental procedure)</p>
    <p>E-Description: Elaborate on what this event is. Do not use
        commas
        in the description since this will cause an
        error. (Example: This indicates when the participant was exposed to the stimuli.)</p>
    <p>F and G-Tags: These are where the stimuli, actions performed, and other important information is documented
        that
        occurred in the event and can be grouped using parenthesis ( (A/B, C/D/E) ), sequenced (A/B~C/D/E), or both
        (
        (A/B,C/D)~(E/F/G) ). (Examples: Action/Button press, (Attribute/Onset, Sensory presentation/Visual/Rendering
        type/Screen/Movie, Item/Film clip/Animation), (Sensory
        presentation/Auditory/Bang)~(Action/Involuntary/Fall))</p>
    <p>Required columns are underlined.</p>
    <p>The Tags Columns can be separated into different columns as shown to better specify what the event is for,
        but a
        single column containing them works as well.</p>
    <h3 id="setup_tsv">How to set up your spreadsheet as a tab-separated text file:</h3>
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/setup_tsv_spreadsheet.png') }}">
    <p>Above is an example of a functional and validated tab-separated text file of tags. The data shown here is
        separated by a tab between each columns value. In this case there are 6 tabs for each line. The columns do
        not
        line up visually, but the program only accesses the next column</p>
