Tags with the isNumeric attribute must have a numerical value. Some tags that are numerical have units associated with them that can be specified. If not, the default units will be assigned to them as determined by the unit class attribute. A unit class contains a collection of units of the same unit dimension (e.g., length, time, angle, etc.). When units are specified for a numerical tag the validator verifies that the units belong to the correct unit class for a particular tag.
